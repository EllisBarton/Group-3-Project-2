# Data Set Description 
The data set in our project is provided by the Centers for Disease and Prevention (CDC) through the Data.gov catalog. This dataset tracks conditions that contributed to deaths involving COVID-19 by state only in the United States and age groups from January 2020 to September 2023. It includes both direct causes and contributing factors of death.  

# Questions 

1. How do COVID-19 death rates vary across different age groups and states? This question aims to uncover disparities in the impact of COVID-19 on various demographic groups, potentially influencing public health policies and resource allocation. This is useful for the government to budget for individual states and to inform hospitals in each location on the severity of the virus in their state.

2. What are the two most common conditions that contributed to COVID-19 deaths? Importance: Identifying the primary causes of COVID-19 deaths allows us to identify higher-risk populations and implement more effective preventive measures. Also, understanding the two most common conditions that lead to COVID-19 allows policymakers and public health officials to allocate medical resources more efficiently. This understanding of conditions emphasizes the importance of targeted healthcare interventions and enables tailoring healthcare responses and preventive measures for at-risk populations.

# Data Manipulations
- **Filtering and Grouping:** The data may be filtered by specific states or age groups and aggregated to summarize COVID-19 deaths and comorbidities.
- **Calculations:** Calculate death rates by dividing the number of COVID-19 deaths by the total number of mentions to understand the prevalence of comorbid conditions.

# Analysis and Results
Using Tableau, we will visualize the data to answer the proposed questions. The visualizations will likely include:
- Bar graphs showing the distribution of COVID-19 deaths by age and state.
- Pie charts or heat maps displaying the prevalence of different comorbid conditions across various demographics.
Our analysis's implications could inform public health strategies, resource distribution, and awareness campaigns focused on the most affected populations.

Analysis for COVID-19 Death Rates Across Age Groups and States:
Significant differences in COVID-19 death rates between age groups and states are shown by visualizing the data. The analysis shows that compared to younger demographics, certain age groups—such as older adults—have higher mortality rates. Furthermore, the severity of COVID-19's impact varies amongst states; certain areas have seen more serious outbreaks than others. These results highlight the significance of individualized public health policies and strategies for allocating resources. For example, states with high transmission rates may need more support in the form of medical supplies and personnel, while high-risk age groups may need targeted vaccination campaigns and improved healthcare services.

Identification of Primary Conditions Contributing to COVID-19 Deaths:
The analysis identifies the two most common illnesses contributing to COVID-19 deaths, providing important details for targeted intervention strategies. By determining these underlying causes, lawmakers and public health specialists can allocate resources and prioritize preventive measures more effectively. For example, if diabetes and cardiovascular disease prove to be the primary causes of COVID-19 mortality, interventions such as health education campaigns targeting these conditions and prioritizing vaccination for those with these comorbidities can be implemented. Moreover, knowing the underlying causes emphasizes the need for tailored healthcare responses, ensuring that populations at risk get the support and interventions needed to successfully lower the risks related to COVID-19.
